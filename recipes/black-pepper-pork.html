    <p><h2>How to make Phuket Style Black Pepper Pork Belly</h2></p>
    <p>I first experienced this delectable dish at Prai Raya in Bangkok,
         a renowned restaurant specializing in Southern Thai cuisine. 
         Although I had various thai dishes before, 
         mu hong had somehow eluded my taste buds until I randomly stopped by 
         this restaurant after being fitted for suits at a nearby tailor. 
         Having never had real southern thai style food, I asked the waitress
         what she recomended and this was the first thing she pointed out. 
         Being a lover of pork belly, I had to try it.</p>
         <p>The dish arrived in all its glory, succulent chunks of pork belly, 
         perfectly cooked, bathed in a rich,
         caramelized gravy infused with bold notes of black pepper. 
         The pork was exceptionally tender, maintaining its structure yet 
         melting in the mouth, with an ideal balance of fat ensuring moist 
         juiciness. This flavor profile leaned towards the savory side, 
         thanks to the prominent black pepper and soy sauce, rather than 
         being overly sweet. I was captivated by its excellence, and ever 
         since, I've been recreating this dish at home. A unique aspect of 
         Thai cuisine is its use of sugar as a preservation technique, so 
         I recommend preparing this dish a day or two ahead of time to 
         allow the flavors to deepen and reach extraordinary heights.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 lb 12 oz pork belly, cut into 1 and 1/2 in cubes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped coriander (cilantro) root or coriander stem</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons black peppercorns</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons rendered pork fat (nahm man)</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons palm or brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons black soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 star anise, toasted</li>
            <li>2 in piece of cassia bark, toasted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white cardamom pods (about 6 pods), toasted</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves, fresh or dried</li>
            <li>4 cups pork stock (nahm cheua mu)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 dried mandarin peel (optional, see note)</li>
            <li>1 pandan leaf, knotted (optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coriander (cilantro) sprigs, snipped into shorter sprigs of leaf and stem</li>
            <li>salt</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
         <p><strong>Dried Orange Peel</strong> This is used to give a 
         sweet flavor in the background of the dish. You can create your 
         own by drying mandarin or clementine peels in an oven on low 
         (130°F/lowest possible) or dehydrator until bone dry, then storing
         in an airtight container</p>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Wash the pork belly under cold running water, then transfer to a large stockpot and cover with water that’s been lightly 
                seasoned with salt. Bring to the boil, then drain and wash the pork belly and stockpot of any scum. Repeat this 
                coldblanching process once more, then set the washed pork belly aside. This will remove impurities from the meat, 
                giving you a clear final sauce and reducing the cooking time. If you prefer to skip this step, that’s fine; as mentioned, 
                the cook time will be longer and the final broth will be cloudy, but the finished dish will be equally delicious!</li>
            <li>In a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander root, garlic, peppercorns and 1 teaspoon of salt to a coarse paste. Heat the 
                pork fat in a wok or heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat. Add the paste and fry for 3–5 minutes until aromatic and 
                fragrant, then add the blanched pork belly and begin to sear and lightly colour the meat all over, stirring all the while 
                to prevent the meat from catching and burning</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, black soy sauce, star anise, cassia bark, cardamom pods and bay leaves. Allow the sugar to melt and 
                caramelise with the pork belly; it should stick and cling to the meat. Stir to evenly coat all the meat with the caramel.</li>
            <li>Add the stock, then season with the light soy sauce. Add the dried mandarin peel and knotted pandan leaf, if using. 
                Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 2–3 hours until the pork belly is tender but holds its shape 
                with a slight bounce, topping up the pan with extra stock or water as required during the cooking time to keep the meat 
                covered.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat and cook for another 10–15 minutes to reduce the braising liquor by half so that it’s thick and glossy 
                and coats the meat. Be sure to stir the meat during this step so that it doesn’t catch and burn on the base of the pan. 
                The desired consistency should coat the back of a spoon, and it should taste sweet and savoury with a peppery finish. Top 
                with snipped coriander sprigs and serve.</li>
         </ol>
