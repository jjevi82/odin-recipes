    <h2>How to make Thai Style Fried Chicken (Hat Yai)</h2>
    <p>I can recall my initial stroll through the early morning 
        streets of Bangkok when I unexpectedly encountered a 
        street vendor offering fried chicken. Fried chicken at 
        7 a.m.? It struck me as unusual, but I thought, "Why not?" 
        As it turns out, fried chicken is a typical morning dish 
        in Thailand, and I'm thrilled I gave it a shot. Undoubtedly, 
        Thai fried chicken is unparalleled in its deliciousness. 
        I embarked on a journey to uncover the secrets of their unique 
        preparation, and the recipe provided below represents the 
        finest version I've managed to replicate.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bone in Skin on Chicken</li>
            <li>Tempura Flour</li>
            <li>shallots</li>
            <li>Fish Sauce</li>
            <li>Palm Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Coriander seeds, cumin seeds, black peppercorns, coriander root</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Ice cold water</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fry the shallots</strong> Thinly slice the shallots into even-sized pieces. Lay them out on a paper towel and sprinkle with some salt. This helps extract moisture. After 10 minutes, gently pat the shallots with another paper towel to remove excess moisture. Then, heat up oil in a pan, and fry the shallots until golden and crispy. Place them on a paper towel to let extra oil drain. Fry the chicken in the same oil to infuse it with shallot flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Pound the spices</strong> Toast cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and black peppercorns until fragrant or 20 seconds. Use a granite mortar and pestle to pound garlic, coriander seeds, coriander root, cumin seeds, and black peppercorns.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the marindade</strong> Transfer the spice mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add palm sugar, fish sauce, and salt. Tip: Use a mixing glove to blend the ingredients. Add tempura flour into the bowl, and slowly add ice-cold water while constantly kneading with your hand until you reach a sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Marinate the chicken</strong> If you use chicken legs, make two slices around the bone. Add the chicken to the marinade and thoroughly coat each piece with the marinade sauce. Transfer to your refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep-fry the chicken</strong> Fry the chicken in a deep frying pan, use the same oil you used for the fried shallots. Make sure there is enough oil to submerge the chicken. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of approximately 350째F to 375째F (175째C to 190째C). Fry the chicken until cooked and golden brown, flip occasionally. The exact time needed depends on the cut of your chicken. To ensure it is fully cooked, you can use a kitchen thermometer. Once it is cooked, place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil. Let the chicken rest for several minutes before serving.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish with the crispy fried shallots</strong></li>

        </ol>
